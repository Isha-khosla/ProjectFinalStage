Stayfit has come into existence in order to offer all our clients the nutrition and diet counseling that they may need which begins at home.  Each client receives a free initial consult  upon joining Stayfit.  In addition, our special routines may give general diet and nutritional advice. You might not know the difference between carbohydrates and protein at the moment. And you might not be able to tell the difference between fat, fatty acids, and fiber. All this can change, however, after a single session with one of our personal online trainers!
Together, you and your specially-selected personal trainer will be able to work out just what you need and when. You’ll work out a diet and training plan that’s perfectly tailored for you which you may start doing at home. This is unike  many traditional gyms. With Stayfit, your personal online trainer will follow your progress and modify your exercise plan as necessary </p>

<h3>Yoga, Meditation and Pilates</h3>
<p>
We believe ‘Yoga is nothing without a home practice’. Home practice gives self-insight into how you respond to difficulty and ease, heightens self-awareness of the body, and cultivates your ability to care for yourself. But starting – or resuming – your home practice can be intimidating, hard to manage, or just plain dull. Discover these tips for starting and maintaining your home practice with Fat to Fit.

 

"People with a home practice are less likely to be acting under the influence of ‘ego' and more likely to listening compassionately to their body's inner wisdom and what it needs at any given time," says our fitness expert ,  who teaches the women's health components of the Byron Yoga .</p>

<h3>Gym Routines</h3>
<p>

Who needs a gym when you have two arms, two legs, and a torso? No one, according to BJ Gaddour, author of the Men's Health book "Your Body is Your Barbell". 

"Bodyweight training teaches you how to first move your own body, developing total fitness with mobility—something most of us desk jockeys need the most," says Gaddour. What's more, if you do it right, you can build just as much—if not more—functional strength than a pro bodybuilder. Don't get us wrong—weight training is awesome and definitely has its place in our fitness routine. Our main aim is to throw shade on the common criticism of bodyweight training: that it's more for endurance, not for building strength. With our fitness gym program of smart progressions—that is, what to do when a move gets too easy—each exercise can keep you getting stronger as you become leaner and more toned. </p>
